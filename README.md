"John Doe"
"Green Transport Co"
u3)
\`\`\`

### 3. Record Emissions
Verified managers can record emission data:

\`\`\`clarity
(contract-call? .emission-tracking record-emission
"TRUCK001"
"truck"
u500
u80
u216)
\`\`\`

### 4. Calculate Footprints
Create footprint calculations from emission data:

\`\`\`clarity
(contract-call? .footprint-calculation create-footprint-calculation
(list u1 u2 u3))
\`\`\`

### 5. Purchase Offsets
Create offset projects and purchase credits:

\`\`\`clarity
(contract-call? .offset-coordination create-offset-project
"Forest Restoration"
"reforestation"
u1000
u25)

(contract-call? .offset-coordination purchase-offsets u1 u100)
\`\`\`

### 6. Generate Reports
Create automated sustainability reports:

\`\`\`clarity
(contract-call? .reporting-automation generate-report
"Q1-2024"
u1
(list u1 u2))
\`\`\`

## Testing

The project includes comprehensive tests using Vitest:

\`\`\`bash
npm test
\`\`\`

Tests cover:
- Manager verification and authorization
- Emission recording and retrieval
- Footprint calculations
- Offset coordination
- Report generation

## Data Flow

1. **Manager Verification**: Sustainability managers are verified by contract owner
2. **Emission Recording**: Verified managers record transportation emissions
3. **Footprint Calculation**: System calculates carbon footprints from emission data
4. **Offset Coordination**: Managers create and purchase offset credits
5. **Report Generation**: Automated reports combine emissions and offsets

## Security Features

- **Access Control**: Only verified managers can perform operations
- **Data Validation**: Input validation prevents invalid data entry
- **Immutable Records**: Blockchain ensures tamper-proof emission records
- **Transparent Reporting**: All calculations and offsets are publicly verifiable

## Emission Factors

The system uses standard emission factors (per 100 units for precision):
- Truck: 2.7 kg CO2/liter
- Car: 2.3 kg CO2/liter
- Bus: 2.6 kg CO2/liter
- Default: 2.5 kg CO2/liter
